## Motivation
This project was created as the Capstone assessment of Genesis10's Dev10 program - Data Professional track.
The project idea is to serve a hypothetical client, with the goal of improving accurate diagnoses for patients experiencing chest pain or 
wanting to get their heart examined, while minimizing costs. The client will establish clinics in locations recommended by the group, with 
the intention of serving the largest number of patients in need of these services. 

## File Structure
* Code: contains all code files for the project, including machine learning code and preliminary data exploration code
  * Heart_ML_Improve.ipynb - final ML version used in predicting heart disease
* Data: contains all datasets used
  * Dataset used for heart disease prediction ML - heart.csv
  * Datasets used for determining client clinic locations - CDC_Risk_Factor_Data.csv, CDC_Metro_Data.csv (see ETL to access Census data)
* Documents: contains all working non data/code documents
* Model: contains all output .model files for each model tested by group
* Project Specifications - contains all final project deliverables used for project ideation, planning, design, and reporting (properly named)
